##  Project Files

### alien_invasion.py
The main file, alien_invasion.py, contains the AlienInvasion class. This class
creates a number of important attributes used throughout the game: the
settings are assigned to settings, the main display surface is assigned to
screen, and a ship instance is created in this file as well. The main loop of
the game, a while loop, is also stored in this module. The while loop calls
_check_events(), ship.update(), and _update_screen().
The _check_events() method detects relevant events, such as key
presses and releases, and processes each of these types of events through
the methods _check_keydown_events() and _check_keyup_events(). The AlienInvasion class also
contains _update_screen(), which redraws the screen on each pass through
the main loop.
The alien_invasion.py file is the only file you need to run when you want
to play Alien Invasion. The other files—settings.py and ship.py—contain code
that is imported into this file.

### settings.py
The settings.py file contains the Settings class. This class only has an __init__()
method, which initializes attributes controlling the game’s appearance and
the ship’s speed.

### ship.py
The ship.py file contains the Ship class. The Ship class has an __init__()
method, an update() method to manage the ship’s position, and a blitme()
method to draw the ship to the screen. The image of the ship is stored in
ship.bmp, which is in the images folder.
